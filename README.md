# Welcome to week 4!  

## Reminders:

The **Files** area to the left shows an index.js file and this "readme" file. For this exercise you only need to work with and edit code within the index.js file.

The **Editor** section in the middle (where you're reading this at) is where you will be editing the index.js file. One thing that will likely look different from a normal text editor or word editor is that different portions of the code will be colored in different ways. This is called *Syntax Highlighting* and is useful when working in a code file to quickly identify the different parts of the code.

The **Console** section on the right is where you will see output from any console.log code you write to test your code. For right now, it's just a panel that shows you the some option buttons and the name and author of this work. After you read the rest of this page, you'll fork the assignment (instructions below) and will see the console log in place of the information panel. There are further details in the index.js on the console.logs, how/where to use them, and how to run your code, as well as more details below.

The **Shell** section (the tab next to Console in the panel to the right) will not be needed, so you can close it by clicking the X on that tab anytime.

### Opening and Running Index.js
If index.js is not already a tab available here in the Editor part of the interface _**after**_ you fork the assignment, double click on the index.js file name in the Files panel on the left to open it.  When you write code in the index.js file, the code will not run until you have saved (or until your file autosaved) and you click the green "Run" button at the top of the webpage.  The results of running your code will be seen in the Console pane to the right.  If your code runs and runs and eventually gives you an error or time out message, you may have an infinite loop in your code so double check your code.

### Debugging
You should use `console.log` to output values in the code when it is run to assist in debugging. For example, if you are having an issue with something related to the `firstName` variable you might add this line of code right below the variable to see what the actual value is at that point `console.log('firstName variable is: ', firstName)`.  Then run the file by clicking the Run button and looking at the output in the **Console**.  Last week you were given some console.log's to start with then created your own.  This week you'll make them all yourself.  Be sure you follow that pattern for all of the questions.

### Getting help
Refer to your lessons materials, contact class mentors, or reach out to your cohort leader(s) if you need any help.  Happy coding!

## Instructions
As you did last week, you'll need to fork this code to get started. Click the "Fork" button to the right under the big green "Run" button to make a copy of this starter code for yourself.  When the window opens, rename the assignment to "_Your Name Here_ - Lesson 4" and then click the blue Fork button.
